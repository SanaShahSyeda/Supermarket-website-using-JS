Vegetables can be broadly categorized into four main groups based on the part of the plant that is consumed. These categories are:

Root Vegetables: These are vegetables where the edible part is the underground portion of the plant. They store energy in the form of carbohydrates. Examples of root vegetables include carrots, beets, radishes, turnips, and sweet potatoes.

Leafy Greens: This category includes vegetables with edible leaves. Leafy greens are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Examples include spinach, lettuce, kale, Swiss chard, and collard greens.

Stem and Shoot Vegetables: These are vegetables where the edible part is the stem or shoot of the plant. They are typically tender and have a mild flavor. Examples include asparagus and celery.

Fruit Vegetables: This category includes vegetables that are botanically classified as fruits but are commonly used in savory dishes. These vegetables often have seeds and a soft flesh. Examples include tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplants (aubergines), and peppers.

It's important to note that the classification of vegetables can vary based on culinary and botanical considerations. For instance, tomatoes and avocados are botanically fruits but are often used and considered as vegetables in cooking. Regardless of their category, all vegetables provide valuable nutrients and contribute to a healthy and balanced diet.
